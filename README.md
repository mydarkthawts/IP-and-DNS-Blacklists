# IP-and-DNS-Blacklists
I've pulled these VPN blocklists from numerous official API sources, and parsed out both IP entry and exit addresses as well as domains using grep on linux. These work wonderfully in pfBlockerng custom whitelisting or blacklisting.

I do not condone censorship.
I do, however, understand when an enterprise or small business environment needs these for their firewall to maintain compliance with their vendors and insurance companies, as well as their OpSec policies.

Please let me know if you find any errors.
I've just started and this will take time.

My first list is ProtonVPN Entry and Exit IP lists.
My second list is ProtonVPN Domains used to query those. 

These lists will be parsed and accurate to the date they are modified here on Github.
